# Security Suggestions
## TL;DR : 
Everything we do, everything we say, everything we post online is PUBLIC to the entire world and is such forever.  For-ev-ah.
What we say, what we do, and who we interact with has an immediate and direct effect on us, our family, and those in our community.

Below are a few ideas that you might incorporate (or already be doing!) that can help you to maintain as much privacy as possible.

## Beginner
* **Reminder: None of our communications online, text messages, or calls are private**.
* "100% security" or "bulletproof" is a myth, no matter what a security system might indicate.

1. Change passwords for each and every site
    * Easiest method is to write passwords down on a physical medium
    * Computers do not care about numbers, special characters, or other fancy text; to a computer it is all the same
    * [LENGTH is the only certain means](https://xkcd.com/936/) to slow down an algorithm from breaking your password in a reasonable time (recommend 16 or more characters for a strong password)
2. If a private matter is to be discussed, do it in person
   * Hard to crack low-tech solutions
3. Refrain from logging onto a computer, or a network, that you do not own
   * The most common and easiest way for thieves to steal your identity is for you to use a computer that is rigged or a network that is compromised.  
     * Just. Don't. Do. It.
4. Choose a Privacy-Focused browser
   * Use Brave or DuckDuckGo.  Do not use Chrome.
   * Don’t sign in on your browser
   * Be wary of Browser Fingerprinting (Brave has the option to disable this)
   * Avoid using Google search engine when possible (and their products too, if you can help it)
5. Don't Use Voice Texting Features
   * Your keyboard on your smartphone needs to send everything you say to Google Servers
   * Keeps a record of everything you sent to it to "help" you with difficult words or phrases
6. Choose a Privacy-Focused Search Engine
   * DuckDuckGo
   * Don’t Share Location With Apps
   * By default, disable GPS location on your device
   * Go through all app settings and disable location access for all apps that don’t need it
   * Disable all [Google Activity settings](myactivity.google.com/myactivity)

## Intermediate
1. Seek out a secure email provider
   * The old adage, "If you didn't PAY for the product, **YOU** are the product."
   * Google reads all of your email: All of it. Always. Even drafts.
   * There are many other options of mail providers, ProtonMail is a free option that is easy and growing in features.
2. Avoid "smart" home devices (Alexa, Google Home, etc)
   * These devices are constantly listening, like a phone, in every room, all the time ("Hello, Google!")
3. Use a Password Manager
   * BitWarden, LastPass, OnePass are all decent options in this realm
   * Keep track of your passwords with one master password (that is plenty long and only YOU know!)
   * Have built-in generators that will easily create difficult passwords for computers to hack
4. Enable 2 Factor Authentication
   * Enable 2 factor authentication whenever available
   * Requires authentication with a physical device that is specific to you
   * Some password managers offer solutions to make this easier
5. Use a secure cloud storage provider, like pCloud, NordLocker, etc (there are other options available)
6. Secure all your images, documents, music, etc on a home computer

## Advanced
1. Use a VPN
   * Protect your IP address from being tracked by sites
   * Encrypt your data
   * Shield your web activity from your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
   * Choose a VPN provider that does not keep logs of your data  
        1. NordVPN
        2. ProtonVPN
        3. ExpressVPN
        4. Surfshark
2. Back up your data to a home server (perhaps using a RAID configuration)
3. Switch from using your ISP's DNS to a 3rd party DNS
4. Secure your work only using paid, proven, and security-first cloud provider services
5. Clean your cache, bookmarks, history in web browser after EVERY visit (when you close the browser)
