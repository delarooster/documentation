# Security Suggestions
## TL;DR : 
Everything we do, everything we say, everything we post online is PUBLIC to the entire world and is such forever.  For-ev-ah.
What we say, what we do, and who we interact with has an immediate and direct effect on us, our family, and those in our community.

Below are a few ideas that you might incorporate (or already be doing!) that can help you to maintain as much privacy as possible.

## Beginner
**Reminder: None of our communications online, text messages, or calls are private**.

"100% security" or "bulletproof" is a myth, no matter what a security system might indicate. In today's world the goal is to make it a _little_ more difficult for those with nefarious intentions to track you, to log you, to know each and every detail about you. In this way you make yourself a more formidable target and, likely, the culprit is apt to move on to an easier choice for prey.  Ultimately, like many animals in the wild, we want them to choose to leave us alone by making our information, our privacy, more difficult to assert than the next possible victim.

### Tips

1. Change passwords for each and every site
    * Easiest method is to write passwords down on a physical medium
    * Computers do not care about numbers, special characters, or other fancy text; to a computer it is all the same
    * [LENGTH is the only certain means](https://xkcd.com/936/) to slow down an algorithm from breaking your password in a reasonable time
      - Recommend 16 or more characters for a strong password (https://xkcd.com/936/)
2. If a private matter is to be discussed, do it **in person**
   * Hard to crack low-tech solutions
3. Refrain from logging onto a computer, or a network, that you do not own
   * The most common and easiest way for thieves to steal your identity is for you to use a computer that is rigged or a network that is compromised.  
     * Just. Don't. Do. It.
4. Choose a Privacy-Focused browser
   * Use Brave or DuckDuckGo.  Do not use Chrome.
   * Don’t sign in on your browser
   * Be wary of Browser Fingerprinting (Brave has the option to disable this)
   * Avoid using Google search engine when possible (and their products too, if you can help it)
5. Avoid using Voice Texting Features
   * Your keyboard on your smartphone needs to send everything you say to Google Servers
   * Keeps a record of everything you sent to it to "help" you with difficult words or phrases
6. Choose a Privacy-Focused Search Engine
   * DuckDuckGo
   * Don’t Share Location With Apps
       - By default, disable GPS location on your device
       - Go through all app settings and disable location access for all apps that don’t need it
   * Disable all [Google Activity settings](myactivity.google.com/myactivity) (myactivity.google.com/myactivity)

## Intermediate

### Tips
1. Seek out a secure email provider
   * The old adage, "If you didn't PAY for the product, **YOU** are the product."
   * Google reads all of your email: All of it. Always. Even drafts.
   * There are many other options of mail providers, ProtonMail is a free option that is easy and growing in features.
2. Avoid "smart" home devices (Alexa, Google Home, etc)
   * These devices are constantly listening, like a phone, in every room, all the time ("Hello, Google!")
3. Use a Password Manager
   * BitWarden, LastPass, OnePass are all decent options in this realm
   * Keep track of your passwords with one master password (that is plenty long and only YOU know!)
   * Have built-in generators that will easily create difficult passwords for computers to hack
4. Enable 2 Factor Authentication
   * Requires authentication with a physical device that is specific to you
   * Some password managers offer solutions to make this easier   
   * Enable 2 factor authentication whenever available
5. Use a secure cloud storage provider, like pCloud, NordLocker, etc (there are other options available)
   * Cloud options, while handy, always come with caveats: the "cloud" is _always_ just "someone else's computer"
   * There has to be a physical device _somewhere_: where would *you* like that information to reside?

## Advanced

### Tips
1. Use a VPN
   * Use on each device (computers, cell phones, Xbox, etc)
      - can use on home router to blanket protect ALL devices connected to home network
   * Protect your IP address from being tracked by sites
   * Encrypt your data
   * Shield your web activity from your ISP (Internet Service Provider)
   * Choose a VPN provider that does not keep logs of your data  
        1. NordVPN
        2. ProtonVPN
        3. ExpressVPN
        4. Surfshark
2. Back up your data to a home server
   * More safe on the internet is simply not being ON the internet or connected to the internet, and done securely at temporarily when needed
   * Secure all your archive images, documents, music, etc on a home computer for later perusal
   * Set up RAID configuration for your hard drives to assist redundancy and backup (physical media, even disks, eventually DO fail) 
3. Switch from using your ISP's DNS to a 3rd party DNS (e.g. OpenDNS)
4. Secure your work only using paid, proven, and security-first cloud provider services
5. Clean your cache, bookmarks, history in web browser after EVERY visit (when you close the browser)
   * Attempt is to "clean" the fingerprint of your personality once you leave using a browser for that session
   * This makes it more difficult to track and to triangulate your particular person that is browsing the interwebs
