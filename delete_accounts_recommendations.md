# Tips for Removing Your Data From Big Tech

## Social Media

There are many resources online that can tell you how to delete your social media accounts. A quick internet search will bring up plenty of links with the steps in the process for the site you wish to delete your account. There are few things to consider when deleting your account:

1. Download your data first; most social media sites offer the option of downloading all data they have about you (e.g. posts, profile information, friend lists...etc)

2. Understand the distinction between deactivating your account and completely deleting it. Deactivation typically preserves your information on the site servers, and deletion completely removes your data. Make sure you are completely deleting your account.

3. Social media sites typically make it very difficult to fully delete your account. Many (Facebook / Twitter especially) require that you refrain from logging into your account for 30 concurrent days prior to deleting your data. If you log in, that completely stops the deletion process.

4. Have a trusted friend help you with deleting your account. To avoid the temptation to log into your account after deleting it, prior to deleting your account have your friend change the email address and password to your account so you **can't** log in and stop the process, even if you want to in a moment of weakness at a later time. 


## Google

It's nearly impossible to get away from Google on the internet today. If you use a Gmail account or use any of Google's other applications (drive, docs, maps...etc), they are constantly collecting data on you and scanning all data that is stored on their servers. One of the most egregious aspects of this is called Location History. As it can be very difficult to completely leave Google behind (although that is highly recommended!) Below are some initial steps to take in your Google Account as you begin the process of migrating away from Google:

1. Go to https://accounts.google.com & log into your account
2. Select "Data & personalization"
3. Under "Activity Controls", select "Manage Your Activity Controls"
4. On the next screen, turn off Web & App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History, and delete all data under each section

### Additional Steps

1. On all devices you own, delete the Chrome browser and use Brave or another browser that takes step to block your internet history
2. Do not use Google to search the web. DuckDuckGo is a fine alternative. 
3. Find another GPS app on your smartphone for directions; apps like Waze are also owned by Google and track your location. Consider turning off GPS functionality on your phone completely.
